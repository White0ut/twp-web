# Trenary Workflow Project

This is a program intended for use at Western Michigan University by Dr. Robert Trenary. This webapp works in conjunction with a gitolite server with which students are given accounts to. 
Students pull assignments and push their work which can then be pulled by a test package, tested, and reviewed for a final grade. Grades are submitted in a PDF item that begins with 'grade' within the students repository. 
The webapp is here to ease the process fo viewing the state of the repositories, create new assignments, and archive a semesters worth of work to "restart" for another semester.


## TODO:
* List archived courses.
* Download a students work for a course.
* Archive a course.
* Begin a course.
* Check the environment to ensure that repositories, bakups, etc. are in their expected directories.
